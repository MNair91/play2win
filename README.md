# Play2Win - Local Soccer Offensive Play Tracker

## üìä Project Overview

**Play2Win** is a local soccer offensive play tracker designed to analyze and visualize offensive actions of a single team across multiple matches and seasons. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to explore detailed play-level data in a fully browser-based environment without requiring professional datasets or external APIs.

The project emphasizes scalability and realism by including thousands of rows of simulated data spanning multiple seasons, making it ideal for practicing data analysis, visualization, and JavaScript-based manipulation of sports datasets.

- **Play Type Analysis**: Which play types lead to the most goals or high-xG opportunities?
- **Player Impact**: How does player involvement impact the team's offensive success?
- **Location Strategy**: Which field locations or match phases generate the highest scoring chances?
- **Tactical Evolution**: How do offensive strategies change over multiple seasons or against different opponents?
- **Opponent Analysis**: How does performance vary against different opponents?
- **Trend Analysis**: What patterns emerge across different seasons and time periods?
